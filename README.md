# binarytree postorder traversing problem:
The binary tree values are already present in binarytree.python file.

Instructions to run the program:
1. Download the file.
2. Install Jupyter notebook along with python installer version 3.0 or above.
3. Run the project.
4. Input the node value that you want to search.
5. The binary tree:
                        20
             15                 25
         10         18        22          28
       5    11    16  19   21   23    26      30
       
6. After post order traversal: 5,11,10,16,19,18,15,21,23,22,26,30,28,25,20
